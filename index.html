    <p>Kohli was averaging 106 in the last 5 chases in T20’s before this match. And today, after an<br> injured Yuvraj
      laboured to 21 and was dismissed by Faulkner in the 14th over in this Ind vs <br>Aus World T20 encounter, it was
      over to captain (Dhoni) and vice-captain. With 39 required off <br>18 deliveries, it seemed like a hairy end
      approaching. The next 13 balls read 4 4 6 2 1 2 0 4 4 4 0 4 4. <br>Dhoni played only 2 of these and scored 6
      including the winning boundary. Kohli <br>sunk to the ground as the ball crossed the boundary – a departure from
      the usual punch in<br> the air and raised bat celebration testifying how this chase had tested his temperament,
      still<br> he managed to come out on top. <br><br>

      The youngest among three siblings, Kohli was born in Delhi and had a passion for cricket<br> from an age of just three. He would often play gully cricket and it was then that <br>the neighbours suggested that Kohli should get professional training. It was around this <br>time, in the year 1998 that West Delhi Cricket Academy was formed and Kohli was among <br>one of the first students there. Kohli was not only good in cricket, he was an excellent student<br> and is admired by his teachers. <br><br> <span>Start of the Cricket life</span>

    <p>Kohli started his formal cricketing career with the Delhi under 15 teams in October 2002 for <br>the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He scored 72 runs with an average of 34.40 and was the highest<br> run getter for his team. Next year, he became the captain of the team for the same trophy <br>and scored a whopping 390 runs in 5 innings. The Delhi under 15 teams saw a number of<br> wins under his leadership.

      Kohli was chosen in the India under 19 team in the year 2006 for the tour of England. He <br>performed well with the Indians went on to win the series.<br>
      
      In the same year, Kohli made his debut in first-class cricket for Delhi and scored 10 in his<br> debut innings. It was during this time that his father died of brain stroke. Kohli’s commitment<br> towards cricket and his professionalism superseded his personal tragedy. He decided to play<br> for his team against Karnataka a day after his father’s demise. Kohli then went on to play the<br> T-20 format for the Delhi team which earned him recognition and soon a place in the Royal <br>Challengers Bangalore team for $30,000 on a youth contract.<br><br><span>The records</span>

    <p>
      Kohli started a series of records with being the third batsman in the world scoring 1000 ODI <br> runs before turning 22. In 2013, Kohli became the captain of the <br>Indian cricket team for the triangular series in West Indies after Dhoni was injured and found unfit to play. In the second<br> match of the tournament, Kohli scored his first hundred as a captain scoring 102 off 83 balls.<br> In the seven-match ODI series against Australia, Kohli hit the third fastest ODI century,<br> crossing the 100 run mark in 61 balls. In the two-match Test series against West Indies, which<br> is memorable as the last Test series of Tendulkar, Kohli equaled Viv Richard’s record of being <br>the fastest batsman to get 5000 runs in ODI.<br><br><br>

      Virat Kohli has attributed his success to his coach Rajkumar Sharma and the guidance he <br>received from former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi. Such an unbelievable feat of success <br>has not been able to sweep Kohli off the grounds. He remains a very humble person, a true <br>role model for youths of India. Recently, he has been rated 8th in ESPN’s top 10 most popular<br> sportsmen in the world being preceded by sportsmen like Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi,<br> Roger Federer etc. And this is where he belongs.
